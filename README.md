# Atmospheric Water Generator (AWG) Project

## 🌦️ Description
This project is an **Atmospheric Water Generator (AWG)** system that extracts water from humid air using Peltier modules and supplies it to plants through an automated irrigation system. It runs completely off-grid using solar energy.

- Arduino Uno
-  ESP32
- Peltier modules*2
- CPU fans & heat sink*2
- 2-channel relay module
- Soil moisture sensor
- Water pump
- 12V 15 A SMPS
-  12 volt 26ah battery
- Solar panels (Loom Solar 20W x3)
- Smart solar charge controller
- temprature sensor
- UV-c light
- jumper wire
- Wires
- 6A fuse
- 6A fuse holder
- 1A fuse
- !A fuse holder
- Water collection tank and tray
- Humidityfier module
- switches
- zipties
- ultrasonic sensor
- led strip light
- Buck converter 12v-5v
- Feviquick gel
- Ardino cable
- ESP cable

 

## 🔄 Working Principle
1. Peltier modules cool air to condense water.
2. Water is collected in a UV-sanitized container.
3. A soil moisture sensor checks when to water the soil.
4. Water is pumped to plants only when needed.
5. The system is powered fully by solar panels and also supported by on grid power.

## 📱 App Features
- View temperature and humidity
- Check battery percentage
- Monitor charging status
- Turn ON/OFF components manually
- AI-based automation (coming soon)
